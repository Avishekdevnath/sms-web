// ✅ V2 MODELS SUMMARY

V2 Models Created:

1. MissionV2 - Enhanced mission model with fast retrieval arrays and cached counts
   - studentIds, totalStudents, mentorIds, totalMentors, groupIds, totalGroups
   - Auto-updating cached counts via pre-save middleware
   - Comprehensive indexes for fast queries
   - Rich instance methods for participant management
   - Virtual fields for populated data

2. MissionStudentV2 - Student-mission relationship with dual-level status
   - Mission-level status: active, deactive, irregular, completed, dropped, on-hold
   - Group-level status: active, deactive, irregular, on-hold
   - Attendance tracking, progress monitoring, course-specific progress
   - Comprehensive indexes for performance
   - Rich instance and static methods

3. MissionMentorV2 - Mentor-mission relationship with dual-level status
   - Mission-level status: active, deactive, irregular, overloaded, unavailable
   - Group-level statuses array with role management
   - Availability management, capacity tracking, performance metrics
   - Comprehensive indexes for performance
   - Rich instance and static methods

4. MentorshipGroupV2 - Groups formed from existing mission participants
   - References to MissionStudent and MissionMentor collections
   - Meeting schedule management, progress tracking, communication channels
   - Smart meeting date calculation
   - Comprehensive indexes for performance
   - Rich instance and static methods

Key Features:
- ✅ No conflicts with existing V1 models (separate collections)
- ✅ Dual-level status management (mission + group)
- ✅ Fast retrieval with cached counts and ID arrays
- ✅ Comprehensive indexing for performance
- ✅ Rich instance and static methods
- ✅ Virtual fields for populated data
- ✅ Pre-save middleware for data consistency
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- ✅ Comprehensive validation schemas
- ✅ Testing utilities for model verification

Phase 1 Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Next Phase: Phase 2 - V2 API Routes
