# Assignment Management System Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive assignment management system that allows SREs, admins, and managers to submit lists of student emails who have completed specific assignments. The system will automatically update assignment records for specific course offerings of specific batches and semesters.

**Key Requirements:**
- Assignment creation already exists at `/dashboard/admin/assignments`
- Email submissions are assignment-specific (select assignment first, then submit emails)
- No validation of student enrollment in course offerings
- Only published assignments can receive email submissions
- Simplified email status (no complex status management)
- Replace existing `StudentAssignmentSubmission` model with new email-based system
- Main dashboard integration with Mission Hub filtering capabilities
- Fresh start (no data migration from existing system)
- Unlimited email submissions with background processing and rate limiting
- Dedicated page for email submission interface
- Notifications to all non-student members (admin, manager, sre, dev, etc.)
- Toggle publish/unpublish functionality (existing data preserved when unpublished)
- Serverless-compatible background processing for Vercel deployment
- Global rate limiting strategy
- Mission Hub with summary cards and detailed assignment completion tables
- Smart duplicate handling with tracking and reporting
- Enhanced course offering selector with batch-semester-course format

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Models
1. **Assignment** (`src/models/Assignment.ts`)
   - Links to `courseOfferingId`
   - Has title, description, dueAt, publishedAt, maxPoints
   - Created by users

2. **StudentAssignmentSubmission** (`src/models/StudentAssignmentSubmission.ts`)
   - Links assignment to student
   - Tracks submission date, points awarded, file URL, feedback
   - Unique constraint on (assignmentId, studentId)

3. **CourseOffering** (`src/models/CourseOffering.ts`)
   - Links course, batch, and semester
   - Unique constraint on (batchId, semesterId, courseId)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Model Enhancements

#### 1.1 Enhanced Assignment Model with Email Tracking
```typescript
// Update existing src/models/Assignment.ts
export interface IAssignment {
  _id: string;
  courseOfferingId: Types.ObjectId;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  dueAt?: Date;
  publishedAt?: Date | null; // Only published assignments can receive email submissions
  createdBy: Types.ObjectId;
  maxPoints?: number;
  attachments?: IAssignmentAttachment[];
  
  // New fields for email tracking
  completedEmails: {
    email: string;
    studentId?: Types.ObjectId; // Optional, populated if student exists in system
    addedAt: Date;
    addedBy: Types.ObjectId; // SRE/Admin/Manager who added the email
  }[];
  
  // Submission tracking
  emailSubmissions: {
    submittedBy: Types.ObjectId;
    submittedAt: Date;
    emailList: string[];
    processedCount: number;
    successCount: number;
    errorCount: number;
    status: 'completed' | 'failed' | 'partial';
  }[];
  
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

#### 1.2 Simplified Email Processing
```typescript
// No separate models needed - everything is contained within Assignment
// Email processing will directly update the assignment's completedEmails array
// Replace existing StudentAssignmentSubmission model with this new approach
```

#### 1.3 Model Deprecation
- **Remove**: `StudentAssignmentSubmission` model (src/models/StudentAssignmentSubmission.ts)
- **Replace with**: Email-based tracking within Assignment model
- **Migration**: Fresh start - no migration of existing data

### Phase 2: API Development

#### 2.1 Assignment Management APIs
- `GET /api/assignments` - List assignments with filtering
- `POST /api/assignments` - Create new assignment
- `GET /api/assignments/[id]` - Get assignment details
- `PATCH /api/assignments/[id]` - Update assignment
- `DELETE /api/assignments/[id]` - Delete assignment
- `PATCH /api/assignments/[id]/publish` - Toggle publish/unpublish assignment (existing data preserved)

#### 2.2 Email Submission APIs
- `POST /api/assignments/[id]/add-emails` - Add email list to assignment (only for published assignments, serverless background processing)
- `GET /api/assignments/[id]/emails` - Get completed emails list
- `DELETE /api/assignments/[id]/emails/[email]` - Remove specific email from assignment
- `GET /api/assignments/[id]/submissions` - Get email submission history
- `GET /api/assignments/[id]/submissions/[submissionId]/status` - Check background processing status
- `GET /api/assignments/[id]/duplicates` - Get list of duplicate emails from last submission

### Phase 3: UI Development

#### 3.1 Dashboard Integration

- Duplicate detection
- Preview of emails to be processed
- Batch size limits (e.g., 100 emails per submission)
- Progress tracking for large submissions
- Error reporting for invalid emails
```

### Phase 4: Business Logic Implementation

#### 4.1 Email Processing Logic
```typescript
// Email processing workflow:
1. Validate assignment is published (publishedAt is not null)
2. Validate email format and clean spaces
3. Check for duplicates in assignment's completedEmails array
4. Find student by email in system (optional, don't reject if not found)
5. Add only NEW emails to assignment's completedEmails array (skip existing)
6. Track duplicate emails separately for reporting
7. Update emailSubmissions array with submission record
8. Process in serverless background with progress tracking (Vercel-compatible)
9. Send notifications to all non-student members (admin, manager, sre, dev, etc.)
10. Return duplicate email list for user feedback
```

#### 4.2 Data Validation
- Email format validation (any valid email format)
- Space cleaning and trimming
- Assignment must be published (publishedAt not null)
- Permission checking (SRE/Admin/Manager only)
- No validation of student enrollment in course offerings
- Global rate limiting (max submissions per minute across all users)
- Duplicate email tracking and reporting

#### 4.3 Error Handling
- Invalid email formats (reject with error message)
- Non-existent students (accept but mark studentId as null)
- Duplicate submissions (skip duplicates, report count and list)
- Unpublished assignments (reject with error)
- Rate limiting exceeded (reject with retry time)
- Serverless timeout handling (graceful degradation)
- System errors during processing
- Partial processing failures (report success/error counts)

### Phase 5: Integration Points

#### 5.1 Course/Batch/Semester Integration
- Filter assignments by course offering
- Validate submissions against course enrollment
- Update course progress tracking

#### 5.2 User Management Integration
- Role-based access control
- Student email lookup

- **To All Non-Student Members**: Assignment completion rates and statistics
- **Recipients**: admin, manager, sre, dev, mentor, etc. (all roles except 'student')
- **No notifications to students** about being marked as completed

### Phase 6: Advanced Features

}
```

### API Endpoints Structure
```
/api/assignments/
├── GET / (list assignments)
├── POST / (create assignment)
├── GET /[id] (get assignment)
├── PATCH /[id] (update assignment)
├── DELETE /[id] (delete assignment)
├── POST /[id]/add-emails (add email list to assignment)
├── GET /[id]/emails (get completed emails)
├── DELETE /[id]/emails/[email] (remove specific email)
└── PATCH /[id]/emails/[email] (update email status)
```

### UI Component Structure
```
/dashboard/admin/assignments/
├── page.tsx (assignment list - already exists)
├── [id]/
│   ├── page.tsx (assignment details with emails)
│   └── submit-emails/

└── create/
    └── page.tsx (create assignment - already exists)
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**
   - Only SRE, Admin, Manager roles can submit emails
   - Assignment creation restricted to authorized users
   - View permissions based on role and course access

2. **Data Validation**
   - Email format validation
   - Input sanitization
   - Rate limiting for bulk operations
   - File upload restrictions

3. **Audit Trail**
   - Log all email submissions
   - Track user activities
   - Maintain processing history
   - Error logging and monitoring

## Performance Considerations

1. **Bulk Processing**
   - Process emails in batches (no fixed limit, handle dynamically)

   - Global rate limiting to prevent system overload
   - Direct array updates to assignment document
   - Handle serverless timeouts gracefully
   - Clean email formats and remove spaces automatically
   - Add only NEW emails (skip duplicates from existing list)
   - Track and report duplicate emails separately

2. **Database Optimization**
   - Index on completedEmails.email field
   - Index on assignment relationships
   - Optimize array queries for large email lists
   - Use aggregation pipelines for statistics

3. **Caching**
