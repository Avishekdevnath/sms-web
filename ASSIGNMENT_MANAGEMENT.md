## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **API Endpoints**

#### **1. Main Assignment API (`/api/assignments`)**
```typescript
GET /api/assignments?page=1&limit=10&search=term&courseOfferingId=id&published=true

POST /api/assignments/unpublish?id=assignmentId
```
- **Publish assignments** to make them visible to students

### **Assignment Model Structure**
```typescript
interface IAssignment {
  _id: string;
  courseOfferingId: Types.ObjectId;  // Reference to CourseOffering
  title: string;                     // Assignment title
  description?: string;              // Detailed instructions
  dueAt?: Date;                      // Due date and time
  publishedAt?: Date | null;         // Publication timestamp
  createdBy: Types.ObjectId;         // Reference to User (creator)
  maxPoints?: number;                // Maximum points (default: 100)
  attachments?: IAssignmentAttachment[]; // File attachments
  createdAt: Date;

2. View assignment statistics and list
3. Use search to find specific assignments
4. Filter by publication status, course, or due date
5. Navigate through pages if needed

#### **2. Creating a New Assignment**
1. Click "Create Assignment" button
2. Select a course offering from the dropdown
3. Enter assignment title and description
4. Set optional due date and maximum points
5. Add attachments if needed
6. Choose to publish immediately or save as draft
7. Click "Create Assignment" to save

### **For Developers**

#### **1. API Usage**
```typescript
// Fetch assignments with filters
const response = await fetch('/api/assignments?courseOfferingId=123&published=true');

// Create new assignment
const response = await fetch('/api/assignments', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    courseOfferingId: 'course-offering-id',
    title: 'Final Project',
    description: 'Complete project description...',
    dueAt: '2025-01-15T23:59:00Z',
    maxPoints: 100,
    attachments: [{ name: 'Template', url: 'https://example.com/template.pdf' }],
    published: false
  })
});

// Publish assignment
const response = await fetch('/api/assignments/publish?id=assignment-id', {
  method: 'POST'
});
```

#### **2. Status Calculation**
```typescript
const getAssignmentStatus = (assignment) => {
  const now = new Date();
  const dueDate = assignment.dueAt ? new Date(assignment.dueAt) : null;
  const publishedAt = assignment.publishedAt ? new Date(assignment.publishedAt) : null;

  if (!publishedAt) return { status: "Draft", color: "bg-gray-100 text-gray-800" };
  if (dueDate && now > dueDate) return { status: "Overdue", color: "bg-red-100 text-red-800" };
  if (dueDate && now < dueDate) return { status: "Active", color: "bg-green-100 text-green-800" };
  return { status: "Published", color: "bg-blue-100 text-blue-800" };
};
```
